The dataset includes 207 images.
Water-leakage are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 512x512 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -13 and +13 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.8 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.5 percent of pixels
